## Exercise - Failable Initializers

 Create a `Computer` struct with two properties, `ram` and `yearManufactured`, where both parameters are of type `Int`. Create a failable initializer that will only create an instance of `Computer` if `ram` is greater than 0, and if `yearManufactured` is greater than 1970, and less than 2020.

struct Computer{
    var ram : Int
    var yearManufactured : Int
    init?(ram : Int, year : Int){
        //Must have more than 0 ram
        if(ram <= 0){
        return nil
    }
    //Valid Manufacturing date between 1970 and 2020
    if( year <= 1970 || year >= 2020){
    return nil
    }

    }
}

//:  Create two instances of `Computer?` using the failable initializer. One instance should use values that will have a value within the optional, and the other should result in `nil`. Use if-let syntax to unwrap each of the `Computer?` objects and print the `ram` and `yearManufactured` if the optional contains a value.
    var computer1 : Computer? = Computer(ram: 16, year: 1970)
    if let computer = computer1{
        print(computer.ram)
        print(computer.yearManufactured)
    }
    var computer2 : Computer? = Computer(ram: 8, year: 1971)
    if let computer = computer2{
        print(computer.ram)
        print(computer.yearManufactured)
