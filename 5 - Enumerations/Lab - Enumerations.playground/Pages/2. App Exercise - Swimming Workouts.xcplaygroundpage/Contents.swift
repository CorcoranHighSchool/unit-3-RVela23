## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.
 */
struct SwimmingWorkout{
    enum Stroke{
        case freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke
    }
    var distance : Double
    var time : Double
    var stroke : Stroke
    static var freestyle : [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var butterfly : [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var backstroke : [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var breaststroke : [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    func save(){
        switch self.stroke{
        case . butterfly :
            SwimmingWorkout.butterfly.append(self)
        case .backstroke :
            SwimmingWorkout.backstroke.append(self)
        case .breaststroke :
            SwimmingWorkout.breaststroke.append(self)
        case .freestyle :
            SwimmingWorkout.freestyle.append(self)
        
            
            
        default:
            return
        }
    }
}

//:  Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.
var daniel = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 400.5, time: 20.9, stroke: .backstroke)
print("Daniel swam \(daniel.distance) meters in \(daniel.time) seconds while doing the \(daniel.stroke).")

var david = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 50, time: 2, stroke: .butterfly)
print("David swam \(david.distance) meters in \(david.time) seconds while doing the \(david.stroke).")


//:  Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save()` method works properly.
daniel.save()
david.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.freestyle)

daniel.save()
david.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.butterfly)

daniel.save()
david.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.backstroke)

daniel.save()
david.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.breaststroke)
